# [ARCHIVED] ProtoSchool Chengdu

*******************************

### THIS REPO IS NO LONGER IN USE AND HAS BEEN ARCHIVED.

This repo has been archived as part of the transition to ProtoSchool's new local event leadership model, [announced](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/84) in March of 2020. If this group is still hosting ProtoSchool workshops, they'll be listed on our events page.

**Please visit our [events page](https://proto.school/#/events) to find upcoming workshops near you** and learn more about the groups hosting them. 

**Learn more about [hosting events](https://proto.school/#/host)** under our new model, which makes it easier than ever for newcomers to start hosting ProtoSchool workshops based on our interactive [tutorials](https://proto.school/#/tutorials).

*********************************

Welcome to the Chengdu chapter of [ProtoSchool](https://proto.school)!

We are a group of people passionate about the decentralized web and excited to learn, teach, and share ideas. Everyone is welcome!

We focus on building the ecosystem around [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) (a decentralized networking protocol), and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) (a cryptocurrency-powered decentralized storage network), both open source projects sponsored by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/).

Everyone is welcome to join us to learn, to promote, to research, to develop, and to share ideas of the amazing tech together!
